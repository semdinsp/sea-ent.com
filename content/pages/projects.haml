            Batugade
        %p 
          Timor Leste has the only land border crossing in Indoneisa.  Currently  we have a duty free license and a hotel license for Batugade 
          %a(href="projects/batugade")
            (see images).
          Our store in Batugade opened in December 2015.  Sales are excellent and we need more products diversity.  Our online store is open and can be used to schedule pickup at the border.  However, given the cash based economy and limited internet penetration this does not see much use currently.
        %h4  Airport
        %p 
          We plan to launch the Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport (Dili) duty free before Q4 2016.  We anticipate to having stores in both the arrival and departure areas of the airport.
        %h4  Salele/Oecussi
        %p 
          Salele will likely open October 2016.  Oecussi will launch Q1 2017.  This would represent all of the land border crossings with Indonesia and would be a significant achievement and revneue potential.

          Tobacco Distribution,Production and Manufacturing
        %p 
          We plan to start distributing major brands in Timor Leste in Q1 2017.
        %p 
          Eventually we plan to use local tobacco to manufacture cigarettes for a population base of 1.3 milion of which more than 60% smoke.  We would use the profits from cigarette manufactuing to support other local product development.  Our models show that local production would result in a 50% cost improvement over imported products offering a significant cost advantage. This wold also allow us to create more jobs for Timor citizens.

        %p
          We have an agreement to help support the ASEAN games in 2018 by running sms and sratch card funding projects.  We are operating this in partnership with XL, 7-11 stores, Telkcomcel and Indosat. This is primarily a

            corporate social responsibility
          project which builds relationships for future business in Indonesia.

        %h3 Gaming Cafe/Hotel
        %p
          Futher  along in our roadmap is a gaming cafe at border crossings with Indonesia.  This would be contained in small hotels situated at the border.  Similar businesses are very successful in Laos (which addresses the Thai market) and Cambodia (addressing Vietnamese market)
        %p
          The hotel is also very complimentary with the duty free business.  Currently we have a hotel license and are looking for the gaming cafe license to strengthen the business model.
