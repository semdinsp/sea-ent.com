            Batugade
        %p 
          Timor Leste has the only land border crossing in Indoneisa where we have a duty free license and a hotel license   
          %a(href="projects/batugade")
            (see images).
          Our store in Batugade opened in December 2016.  Sales are excellent and we need more products diversity. 
        %h4  Airport
        %p 
          We plan to launch the Dili Airport duty free before Q3 2016.
        %h4  Salele/Oecussi
        %p 
          Salele will likely open June 2016.  Oecussi will launch Q2 2016.  This would represent all of the land border crossings with Indonesia and would be a significant achievement.

        %h3
          Tobacco Production and Manufacturing
        %p 
          We plan to use local tobacco to manufacture cigarettes for a population base of 1.3 milion of which more than 60% smoke.  We would use the profits from cigarette manufactuing to support other local product development.  Our models show that local production would result in a 50% cost improvement over imported products offering a significant cost advantage.

        %p
          We have an agreement to help support the ASEAN games in 2018 by running sms and sratch card funding projects.  We are operating this in partnership with XL, 7-11 stores, Telkcomcel and Indosat. This is primarily a

            corporate social responsibility
          project which builds relationships for future business in Indonesia.

        %h3 Gaming Cafe/Hotel
        %p
          Futher  along in our roadmap is a gaming cafe at border crossings with Indonesia.  This would be contained in small hotels situated at the border.  Similar businesses are very successful in Laos (which addresses the Thai market) and Cambodia (addressing Vietnamese market)
        %p
          The hotel is also very complimentary with the duty free business.  Currently we have a hotel license and are looking for the gaming cafe license to strengthen the business model.
